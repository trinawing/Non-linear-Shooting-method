The simple shooting method is revisited in order to solve nonlinear two-point BVP numerically.
The BVP of the type  is considered where  components of  are known at one of the boundaries and
components of  are specified at the other boundary. 
The map  is assumed to be smooth and satisfies the Lipschitz condition.
